# CSE 472: Machine Learning Sessional

## Course Overview

CSE 472 is a 0.75 credit hour sessional course offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). It is designed for Level 4, Term 2 students and serves as a practical complement to the theoretical concepts covered in CSE 471: Machine Learning.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following assignments (referred to as "Offlines") completed during the course:

- **Offline 1**: Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning 
- **Offline 2**: Logistic Regression and Ensemble Methods
- **Offline 3**: Gaussian Mixture Model with Expectation-Maximization Algorithm
- **Offline 4**: Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch (using only NumPy)

Each assignment is contained within its respective directory, including code, datasets, and reports.

## Getting Started
